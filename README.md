# Development Guide

You should install Python 3.11 first.

* install poetry

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry self add poetry-plugin-shell
```

* install dependencies

```bash
poetry env use 3.11
poetry lock
poetry install --with model
```

* prepare configs

```bash
cp envs/env.template .env
```

* prepare postgres/redis/qdrant/elasticsearch

```bash
make run-db
```

* config MinerU

Run the following command to download models. The script also creates the `magic-pdf.json` file in the current directory.

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
python ./scripts/download_mineru_models.py
```

Optional: Edit `magic-pdf.json`, configure the LLM API settings under the `llm-aided-config` field, and set the `enable` field to `true`. MinerU will then use the LLM for enhanced parsing capabilities, such as correcting OCR errors in text and formulas, and adjusting title levels (otherwise, all titles default to level 1).

* run the django service

```bash
poetry shell
```

```
make run-backend
```

To debug django service, see [HOW-TO-DEBUG.md](docs%2FHOW-TO-DEBUG.md)

* run the celery service

```bash
poetry shell
```

```
PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python celery -A config.celery worker -l INFO --pool threads
```

To debug celery service, see [HOW-TO-DEBUG.md](docs%2FHOW-TO-DEBUG.md)

* run the frontend

```
make run-frontend
```

then open the aperag frontend console: http://localhost:8001
